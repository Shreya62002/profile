<p><strong>Trajectory Tracking And Replication Using UAV <a href="https://github.com/Shreya62002/Trajectory-Tracking-and-Replication-and-Cruise-Controller">Github</a></strong>
<li>
    Aimed to develop a controller for a quadcopter to replicate the
    tracked trajectory of an object.
</li>
<li>
    Implemented color filtering and centroid tracking algorithms, and
    utilized BSpline and RDP algorithms to detect and discretize collected
    waypoints for optimized object tracking and processing.
      
</li>
<li>
    Stored the waypoints and generated a smooth curve trajectory for
    1D, 2D and 3D.
